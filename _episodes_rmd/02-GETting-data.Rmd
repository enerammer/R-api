## Using GET

The site icanhazdadjoke.com offers a wide selection of dad-jokes.


> ## Dad jokes
> a wholesome joke of the type said to be told by fathers with a punchline that is often an obvious or predictable pun or play on words and usually judged to be endearingly corny or unfunny

In addition to the website, an API is available that can be accessed using the  GET method.

The GET method is a generic procedure, we need a function that actually handles the behind-the-scenes-stuff for us.
The library *httr* have an implementation:
```{r}
library(httr)
```

Taking a quick look at the [documentation](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) we first try GET directly:
```{r}
GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/")
```

What is returned is the response from the server. That includes much more than
what we are looking for. Notable is the "Status" part, which we are told is 
"200", which is server-lingo for "everything is OK".

And what do we get? We get a webpage. We can see that the content is 
*DOCTYPE html*. That was not really what we were looking for. HTML is not
 that easy to work with, and contains a lot of extranious information
that we do not  need.

Even if the GET method is relatively simple to work with, we need to add a 
bit more. Again taking a look at the documentation, it appears that we 
need to tell the API, that we would like a specific type of response, rather
than the default html, more specifically "text/plain". 

*httr* has helper functions to assist us. The one we need here is *accept()*
We now use that to tell the server, that we really want a response in just
text:
```{r}
result <- GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", accept("text/plain")) 
result
```
We still get the response from the server, telling us that Status is 200, and
everything is OK. But where is our dad-joke?

It is hidden in the content of the response. It is sent to us as binary code,
so we are using the *content()* function, also from *httr* to extract it:

```{r}
content(result)
```

There is a little warning about the encoding of the string. But now we have a dad-joke!

What if we need to retrieve a specific joke? All the jokes has an ID, that 
we can use for that. If we want to find that, we need a bit more information about the joke. We can get that by specifying that we would like the result of our
GET-request returned as JSON. 


> ## JSON
>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format for structuring, 
>in principle, any kind for text, structured in almost any way.
>It consists of pairs of strings, one denoting the name of the data we
>are looking at, and one containing the content of that data. Each set of 
>data fields are encapsulated in curly braces, and a data field can have 
>subfields, also encapsulated in curly braces. It can look like this:
>
>{
>"firstName": "John",
>"lastName": "Smith",
>"phoneNumbers":{
>  "type": "home",
>  "number": "212 555-1234"
>    },
>    {
>      "type": "office",
>      "number": "646 555-4567"
>    }
>}
>
> JSON is readable for both humans and computers, but can be a bit 
> tricky to convert to dataframes if there are a lot of nested fields.

Looking at the documentation, we see an example, which indicates that what 
we should tell the server that we accept, should be "application/json".
The *httr* library contains helper functions to assist us in manipulating the 
header. We use *accept()* that sets the *accept* part of the header:
```{r}
result <- GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", accept("application/json")) 
result
```

Again - everything is nice and 200 = OK.

We also see a truncated version of the actual joke.

Let us use the content() function to extract the content:

```{r}
content(result)
```
This data is returned as a list, which is the R-default way of 
handling any kind of data.
Status is repeated, and now we have an id. We can use that to extract the 
same joke again.

NOTE: The joke returned is chosen at random. The id used here will probably 
be different from what we found above.

The way to retrieve a specific joke is to GET the URL:

`GET https://icanhazdadjoke.com/j/<joke_id>`

Where we replace the *joke_id* with the specific joke we want. Remember to
specify the result that we want:

```{r}
GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/j/lGJmrrzAsc",  accept("text/plain")) %>% 
  content()
```

We can also search for words in jokes. The documentation tells us, that we 
should send our GET request to the URL 

https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search

And in the examples we get the hint, that we should format the URL as:

https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=<TERM>

Dogs are always fun, let us search for dad jokes about dogs. Specify the
type of result we want, pipe the response to the content() function and save 
it to *result*:

```{r}
result <- GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=dog",
              accept("application/json")) %>% 
          content()
result
```

This is in JSON format. It is clear that the jokes are in the $results part of that
datastructure. How can we get that to a data frame?

the content() function can treat the content of our response in different ways.
If we treat it as text, the function fromJSON from the library *jsonlite*, can 
convert it to a data frame. We begin by loading the library:
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
GET("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=dog", accept("application/json")) %>% 
  content(as="text") %>% 
  fromJSON()
```

We have now seen how to send a request to an API, with search terms 
embedded in the URL.

We have seen how to add an argument to the GET function, that specifies the
type of result we would like, effectively by adding something to the header
of our request.

And we have seen how to extract the results, and get them into a dataframe.

Next, we are going to take a look on how we get results using the POST method,
on an API that provides more factual and serious, but not so funny data.
