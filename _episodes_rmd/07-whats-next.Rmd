The goal of this course was to give an introduction on how to work
with API in general.

For many of the major services online, there exists specialized packages
making it easier to work with their API. 

Ideally we would have a complete list here.

Less ambitiously we would have a solid selection.

For now we have one.

The [gargle package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gargle/index.html),
provides tools for working with the Google APIs.
