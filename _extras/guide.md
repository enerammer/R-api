The idea is to introduce a general approach to retrieving data from an API, 
rather than introducing a set of packages. We are working with both dad jokes 
and Statistics Denmark, in order to introduce both GET and POST requests.

In order to engage the learners it is recommended to run the lessons based on
"what is your favorite table from Statistics Denmark", rather than keeping strictly
to the material.

Getting to the actual data using the Statistics Denmark API is pretty repetitive.
Use the repetions as a tool - you get to try this several times, so you really
get to know the method! Also emphasise that this is the typical approach to
working with APIs. Learners cannot expect to just write a request and get the
data immediately, they have to interact with the API in order to get to know it.

Lists is a new concept not covered in the introductory courses held at KUB Datalab.
Spend some time on it, as we are handling lists containing lists here.
